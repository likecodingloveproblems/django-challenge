# MatchTicketSelling

The volleyball Federation decided to use an online selling platform for the next season, and our company has been chosen for implementing that.

# Requirements

Our system should have REST APIs for the following tasks:

- User signup and login
- Adding a new stadium
- Defining matches
- Defining the place of seats for each match
- Buying seats of a match (There is no need for using a payment gateway)

# Implementation details

We don't need a GUI for this system. You can use the Django admin.
Try to write your code as **reusable** and **readable** as possible. Also, don't forget to **document your code** and clear the reasons for all your decisions in the code.
Using API documentation tools is a plus.
Don't forget that many people trying to buy tickets for a match. So try to implement your code in a way that could handle the load. If your solution is not sample enough for implementing fast, you can just describe it in your documents.

Please fork this repository and add your code to that. Don't forget that your commits are so important. So be sure that you're committing your code often with a proper commit message.

## Settings

Moved to [settings](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

      $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    $ mypy matchticketselling

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    $ coverage run -m pytest
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

#### Running tests with pytest

    $ pytest

### Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation

Moved to [Live reloading and SASS compilation](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-locally.html#sass-compilation-live-reloading).

### Sentry

Sentry is an error logging aggregator service. You can sign up for a free account at <https://sentry.io/signup/?code=cookiecutter> or download and host it yourself.
The system is set up with reasonable defaults, including 404 logging and integration with the WSGI application.

You must set the DSN url in production.
